# Rance's Duplo blocks.

This is my sandbox repo where i throw pieces of codes I might deem useful or implementations of algoritms I will mostly either forget or will be too lazy to reimplement, so I'll put it here for future reference.

## FAQ

### Why not just use github gists?
1. I thought about it and i just happened to be too lazy to sit down and manage github gists individually. Sometimes i just want to sit down and create some of these reusable things and not worry about managing gists. i can just clone push and be done with it. worst case scenario is that i would have to update this file, but I find this even easier than going through gists.

2. I also like the possibility of some of these things growing into libraries with overloads among other things.

3. I can simply clone this repo whenever i want with a simple git clone or download the whole thing from the site and have them at hand.

4. Worse case scenario, i can take this stuff somewhere else if github ever decides to nuke itself.

5. Finally, its my repo so i do whatever i want with it.
